There is much that could be said about rubik cubes, both in the context of a classroom, and outside. 
For most people, it is thought to be a simply toy, a plaything. Most people fail to look past the basis of its creation, and
think thats its a simple process of memorizing algorithms and spitting it back out. Other people look at it as a symbol of intellect
and the ability to problem solve, which is true to some degree, but after a deeper analysis, that isnt totally correct either.

Now we are left with the question of what is a rubiks cube in essence? 
Personally, I think its just a cube. Its nothing special. After looking at it, and thinking, there is nothing special about it in essence.
However, it is made special by the mechanics, algorithms, and mathatics behind it. The rubiks cube can be used a great learning tool for
teachers and students, to understand what is an algorithm. I found that personally it is a great tool for this, since as a visual learner,
I was able to map out and understand what exactly is the fundamentals of an algoritm.
