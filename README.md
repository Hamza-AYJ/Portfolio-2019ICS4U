<h3>Languages Learned: </h3>
Java Script (JS) was the primary language learned in this class. The use of this language increasingly became more and more complicated
and intricate as object oriented code began to play a bigger and bigger role in the programs we were creating. Objects in specific may 
have seemed like a tedious and time consuming task, but when you look at the bigger picture it is actually essential in programming 
natural simulations and delving into the idea of efficient coding. 
<br>
Other small variations of p5.js and processing (JS) were also used in this course to the same degree, and it was found to be similar in 
capability. 
<br>
HTML was the other language that was used to a degree in the course. In the DOM/JQuery the previous concepts of HTML and CSS were 
expanded on in order to code more efficiently and make webpages more interactive. Object oriented code could be interpreted here as the 
change in the elements of the website. Other than that there are a plethora of other uses of this language.

<h3>Learning Experience:</h3>
There is much to say about this years experience in computer science. A lot of the work consisted of khan academy, which allowed for us 
to pick and choose our work flow. It also allowed for us to make sure that the required amount of work got done, and that it could be 
faclitated by our own desire to get it done and make sure we were being responsible. The microbit and arduino in class exercises were 
also an interresting way to make sure that were able to get involved and take a more hands on learning expereince, which showed us 
different sides to coding. Aspects of interrative software and object oriented code were really emphasized this year, as it allowed us 
to discover what really makes code efficient. Algorithms are another element of computer science where we were able to incorporate the 
use of algorithms and the rubiks cubes to provide a better understanding of these patterns.

<h3>Future Learning:</h3>
Free code camp is something that I will definetly be starting after exams, as well as continued work flow on khan academy.
I also wish to expand my knowledge on other coding languages, and perfecting the ones that I currently know. 
Python, Ruby, and Full Stack are all on my list for languages to learn. Furthermore, if I take computer science in university, then 
I will definetly learn more languages and perfect them.
